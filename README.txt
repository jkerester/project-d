1. I (James) did steps 1, 4, 5, and 6. Molly did steps 2 and 3.

2. These steps can be verified by compiling the project with the shell script and running it in the simulator. Typing a command that doesn't exist will print out "Command not recognized." Typing "type messag" will print out the file message.txt and typing "exec tstpr2" will execute tstpr2. If a file that doesn't exist is typed after a command, it will print out "file not found." It will go back to the shell command line after a command is typed and completed.
